# Optimized-Flight-Trip
This report explores the application of AI searching algorithms e.g. BFS-DFS-A*-Greedy-UCS-IDS-DLS in optimizing flight trip planning. By harnessing the power of AI, we aim to develop a system capable of efficiently navigating complex flight networks to identify the most cost-effective and time-efficient routes. This project not only delves into the technical aspects of AI algorithms but also examines their real-world implications for travellers, airlines, and the broader travel industry.
